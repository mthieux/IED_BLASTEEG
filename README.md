These scripts were used for the analyses of "Interictal epileptiform discharges contribute to momentary lapses of attention in children with epilepsy - Thieux et al."

This study is part of a larger project which investigate the influence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) on attention using the BLAST attention test (Petton et al., 2019). This study focuses on the influence of IED on BLAST-scores (reaction time, errors %, Stability and Intensity) and on parietal ERP during BLAST in children, using scalp-EEG recording. 

## Scripts 
The scripts have been writed with Python (3.11.7) and R (4.4.1). 
- behav_stat_analysis.R - runs statistical analyses for BLAST data
- eeg_stat_analysis.R - runs statistical analyses for EEG data
- ERP_analysis.ipynb - runs EEG preprocessing and epoching

## Informations
The scripts are not tailored for general use but feel free to to use and modify. 
Please feel free to contact me at marine.thieux@univ-lyon1.fr for any comment or question.
